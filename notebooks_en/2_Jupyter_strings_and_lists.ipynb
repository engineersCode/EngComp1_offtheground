    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is an open-source project that develops tools for interactive and exploratory computing. These tools allow you to write, run, and share code in different languages: Python, Julia, and R, among others. You work right on your browser, which becomes the user interface through which Jupyter gives you the ability to manage, view and edit files, and a document format: the **notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook can contain: input and output of code, formatted text, images, videos, pretty math equations, and much more. The computer code is _executable_, which means that you can run the bits of code, right in the document, and get the output of that code displayed for you. This interactive way of computing, mixed with the multi-media narrative, allows you to tell a story (even to yourself) with extra powers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter includes several pieces that you will want to know about. Let's do a quick tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a web application for creating and working with interactive documents mixing code, output (including visualizations), and explanatory text. It has been widely adopted by the scientific and data science communities, and integrates with various other tools and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of the notebook format (as of 2023) is **Notebook 7**, with many exciting new features over the previous version (v6, a.k.a. \"classic\"), including: debugger, table of contents, real-time collaboration, accessibility improvements, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a full-featured development environment for Jupyter notebooks and associated files (like data for analysis). In one browser tab, it shows several tiled areas for working with documents, browsing files, launching apps in sub-tabs, and selecting commands from various menus. \n",
    "It is modular and customizable, allowing you to arrange multiple notebooks, terminals, editors, consoles, and other components in a single workspace. You can also drag and drop cells between notebooks, or copy and paste output from one notebook to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab works with the Notebook 7 format by default. You can switch between Notebook 7 and Notebook 6 modes using the menu or toolbar options in JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### _Note:_\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we recommend working in the more focused and simple Notebook interface. More advanced users will likely prefer the Lab interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is a web application for institutions to host and manage multiple Jupyter notebook servers for different users. It is useful for providing a pre-configured data science environment to a group of students, researchers, or data scientists, without requiring them to install or maintain any software on their own machines. You access JupyterHub from the browser with your institutional login.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the George Washington University, we provide a JupyterHub for teaching purposes at: [go.gwu.edu/jupyter](http://go.gwu.edu/jupyter).\n",

    "### Jupyter Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Desktop is an application that lets you run JupyterLab without using a web browser or a command line. It is a convenient and easy way to get started with Jupyter notebooks on your own computer, without having to install or configure anything. You can [download Jupyter Desktop from GitHub](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) and then launch it by clicking its icon in the customary way. Like all the Jupyter tools, it's _free_!"

If a notebook file is publicly available on the web, you can view it by entering its URL in the nbviewer web page, and hitting the **Go!** button. The notebook will be rendered as a static page: visitors can read everything, but they cannot interact with the code. "

For example, you may have to interact with the _command line_, and documents have two types of content—code and markdown—that handle a bit differently. The fact that your browser is an interface to a compute engine (called \"kernel\") leads to some extra housekeeping (like shutting down the kernel). But you'll get used to it pretty quick!"
